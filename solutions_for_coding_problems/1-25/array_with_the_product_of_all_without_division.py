Problem #2 [Hard]: Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].
Follow-up: what if you can't use division?
'''

'''
Without division, another approach would be to first see that the i element simply
needs the product of numbers before i and the product of numbers after i. Then we
could multiply those two numbers to get our desired product. This solution is O(nË†2).
